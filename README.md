# Firebase Cloud Function Asynchronous Operation Bug

This repository demonstrates a common error in Firebase Cloud Functions related to asynchronous operations. The `cloudFunctionBug.js` file shows a function that attempts to write to the Realtime Database before an asynchronous data fetch completes, resulting in incorrect data being written.  The solution, found in `cloudFunctionSolution.js`, addresses this by using promises or async/await to ensure the asynchronous operation finishes before the database write.
